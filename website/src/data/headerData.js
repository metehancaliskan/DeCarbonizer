    "DeCarbonizer is a systematic protocol that effectively dimisnishes the net carbon emisson levels. It transfers net carbon credits and trees, which is treetoken, to blockchain.  With treetokens, companies can get carbon tokens that enables them to relese net carbon. This situation does not cause to increse carbon emission because after some time carbontoken's value will increse because of burn funciton.",
