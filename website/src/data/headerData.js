    "DeCarbonizer is a systematic protocol that effectively diminishes the net carbon emission levels. It transfers net carbon credits and trees, which is Tree Token, to the blockchain.  With Tree Tokens, companies can get carbon tokens that enable them to release net carbon. This situation does not cause an increase in carbon emission because after some time Carbon Token's value will increase thanks to the burning functionality.",
